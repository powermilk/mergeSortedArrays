# MergeSortedArrays

Application merge two sorted arrays in sorted array.

## Getting Started

First, you need to ensure you have this applications:

- [GIT](https://git-scm.com/) - GIT isn't necessary, but is better to have installed
- IDE (I prefer [Intellij Idea](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)) - It isn't necessary, but in IDE you can lookup code quicker and nicer.
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) - necessary to build project, sometimes IDE have internal version of maven
- Java JDK 8 - This one is mandatory ;)

You can download project in two ways:
 - By GIT, typing in console this command:
 ```
 git clone https://github.com/powermilk/fibonacci.git
 ```
 If you dicide using this one, I assume you know a basics of GIT
 - By download ZIP file

 You need to just download [this file](https://github.com/powermilk/fibonacci/archive/master.zip).

### Prerequisites

You can build this project with Maven, so dependencies are automatically downloaded and imported, but for your information I listed what technologies are used in this repository:
- Java 8
- Junit 5 for testing

## Running the tests

I used in this project Maven Surefire, so you can run test with this command:
```
mvn surefire:test
```

## Built With

* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) - Dependency Management

## Versioning
